There are two "secure" pages that you can try to access:

- http://www.se.rit.edu/~dkrutz/swen-344/sessions/session1.php
- http://www.se.rit.edu/~dkrutz/swen-344/sessions/session2.php

Notice that if you try to access these pages without logging in, you are not shown the "special" information. However, if you login, the information on these pages becomes available.
