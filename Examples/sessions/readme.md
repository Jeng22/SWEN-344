# Example PHP Sessions

### You may see a live version here: http://www.se.rit.edu/~dkrutz/swen-344/sessions/index.php


- Login: <whatever you want - I usually enter a name>
- Password: 1234

There are two "secure" pages that you can try to access:

- http://www.se.rit.edu/~dkrutz/swen-344/sessions/session1.php
- http://www.se.rit.edu/~dkrutz/swen-344/sessions/session2.php

Notice that if you try to access these pages without logging in, you are not shown the "special" information. However, if you login, the information on these pages becomes available. You will also notice that your name is shown in the session.

There is also a clear session feature that you can use to remove all session variables.
